# Libcan Arduino Example
This is an implementation of the libcan library for Dronecan running on the STM32

It is taken from [libcanard/examples/ServoNode](https://github.com/dronecan/libcanard/tree/master/examples/ServoNode) and modified to work with stm32.

It uses the [STM32_CAN](https://github.com/pazi88/STM32_CAN/tree/main) library for communication.

Tested on STM32F103CB 128k but should work on any stm32.
